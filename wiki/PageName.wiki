These things would be nice to have a look at:

A list of ideas/thoughts:
  * The board evaluation function _E_ could return a *vector* _E(p)=v_ of values when called on a position _p_.
  * A metric _d(.,.)_ could be defined on such vectors. To compare two positions _p1_ and _p2_ we could use _d(p1, p2)_ where _p2_ is a reachable position either as an immediate sucessor of _p1_ or with a number of moves between _p1_ and _p2_.  
  * Threaded searching
  * Better search statistics/information
  * Min/max search as a reference to compare with when developing other search techniques.
  * Hashing of position evaluations
  * a toFEN function that outputs the current board position in FEN
  * When the king is moved for the first time (a not due to a castling) then the castling-ability is lost. How do we record this event so that the current undo function will work?
  *  Text in *bold* or _italic_
  * Headings, paragraphs, and lists
  * Automatic links to other wiki pages

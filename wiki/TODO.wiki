= TODO List =



A list of ideas/thoughts:
  * The board evaluation function _E_ could return a *vector* _E(p)=v_ of values when called on a position _p_.
  * A metric _d(.,.)_ could be defined on such vectors. To compare two positions _p1_ and _p2_ we could use _d(p1, p2)_ where _p2_ is a reachable position either as an immediate successor of _p1_ or with a number of moves between _p1_ and _p2_.  
  * Threaded searching
  * Hashing of position evaluations
  * a toFEN function that outputs the current board position in FEN 
  * PGN export
  * An optimized movegenerator that generates one move at a time.
  * Draw on threefold repetition
  * inCheck and correct movegeneration
  * 50 move rule draw
  * Principal Variations in search engine
  * Algebraic Long notation export of a game

= Fixed =
  * Movenumbers printed on screen
  * add functionality such that the engine can play against itself. (E.g. random engine against min/max engine or alpha/beta engine). A command could be added *machine n* where n specifies an upper bound on the length of move steps the machine is allowed to play against itself. 
  * When the king is moved for the first time (and not due to a castling) then the castling-ability is lost. This is now recorded in a way where the undo function works.
  * A random move generator was added.
  * Better search statistics/information
  * Min/max search as a reference to compare with when developing other search techniques.
